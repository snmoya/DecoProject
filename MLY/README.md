Installing iOS Simulator:
Xcode > Settings (or Preferences) > Components (or Platform) > "+" (plus button at the bottom) > Select iOS.. > Choose a simulator, the latest would be iOS 18.0. 

- CocoaPods: 
Install CocoaPods for managing iOS dependencies.
```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
```


## Clone the repository

In a new directory run the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/snmoya/DecoProject.git
```
This will clone the complete project (Web + Mobile).


## Running the project

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the app on an iPhone simulator by following these steps:

1. Open Xcode

2. Run the App on Simulator:

- Get into the project directory were you cloned the github code:
```shell
cd /clonePath
```
*replace "/clonePath" with the actual path of the repository clone.

Move into the Mobile app directory:
```shell
cd DecoProject/MLY
```

- In the project directory, run:

```shell
npm install
```
this will install all the necessary dependencies. 

- Then is necessary to install the dependencies for iOS.
```shell
cd ios
pod install
```
*This might take a while...

- After that, back to the mobile app directory:
```shell
cd ..
```

Finally you can run the project:
```shell
npx react-native run-ios
```

This command automatically will:
- Open a new terminal. (Do not do anything in there).
- Open the iPhone simulator. 
    (Maybe you can get a pop-up window telling that the simulator need to boot, that is ok).
- Your current command line is going to be building the app: "Building the app....." (This takes a while)
- After this, the app should open in the simulator. 
- If by any reason you installed more than one simulator, you can specify a particular one.
```shell
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
```
